## How Are You Guys? ü§î

### Finish TomTube as a training.‚ù§
 - The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe website is similar to YouTube, where you can upload videos and so on.
 - You would like to try the site yourself, but I will tell you the steps as an idea.

If you are going to try it yourself: you can try this email or create a new account.
- Email: f0778b1892@boxmail.lol
- Password: 123456
You can try from [Here](http://thomas-emad.ml/projects/TomTube/index.php?v=*).

If you will create a new account:-
- You write your data as normal after that.
- You will open your email to activate the account. That's it.
You can upload videos that you can view, you can search in the search box under the name of the video, you can follow the owner of the page to see his videos, and some nice things that you would like to try.

- Well, I forgot a password, and some information changed after creating an account.
- Log in page, create an account, forgot password, all of them are one page, but it changes by changing the URL.
- On this page, make a 404 Error.
- Of course, if you delete your account or video, files such as photos, videos, and so on will be deleted along with it.

#### It's Have One Problem üò¢:-
 1- You cannot upload a video larger than 5MB, because the server is weak, so I tried on Localhost, and it was normally uploading higher than this üòß.

Which I used:-
1- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
2- PHP, MySQL, Phpmyadmin.
3- phpmailer: To confirm the email, and I forgot the password.
